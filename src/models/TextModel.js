            "Since I was a kid, I've always had a passion for creating. I used to love scribbling random drawings everywhere I could and eventually would start drawing countless floor plans for random building ideas I'd have. And despite how awful all those drawings were in hindsight (definitely not the artist in the family), I loved making them and it fueled my creativity and interest in everything around me from a very young age. By the time I made it to middle and high school, I started gravitating towards how everything around me worked, especially all the technology I was using. This passion for technology people use on a daily basis lead me to pursue Engineering.",
            'While I do enjoy the hardware aspect of my program, I truly fell in love with the software side. So far in my journey, I was able to learn many different languages and technologies in my over 2 years of professional experience. For example, in my last position, I was responsible of developing and iterating on core features of a motion capture solution with a WPF frontend and Python backend. Before that, I was involved in developing an ecommerce web application using Typescript, Vue, Nuxt, GraphQL & NodeJS within a continuous deployment setting. In all my projects, I was heavily involved in their planning, development and deployment processes. This helped me gain a lot of insight into the importance of code maintainability and scalability to ensure functionality years down the line.',
            'In most of my experience, I worked on hundreds of bugs and user stories within an Agile/Scrum environment and used TFS & Git to manage teamwork and source code accordingly. This showed me the importance of being actively involved in different aspects of the development process, from early design meetings to the very final sprints before deploying the project. In my last position especially, I was heavily involved by participating in biweekly sprint planning sessions, retrospectives, backlog grooming and bug bashes.',
            "While I'm not working on work or side projects, I really enjoy working on my music production as it remains my main creative outlet nowadays. I make countless hip-hop/R&B/electronic/latino beats as I always obsess over new synths, plug-ins and sounds/instruments I can use and manipulate. I also enjoy catching up on whatever TV shows I'm currently watching and whatever films/albums that I might've missed during the year."
